Domain: payoff strategies, avalanche vs snowball, refinancing, debt-to-income, debt vs invest allocation
Key observations:
- Mortgage at 6.25% APR, $542K balance — home equity ~$443K. Refinancing worth evaluating.
- Student loans at 4.5%, only $18.4K remaining — close to payoff, may not be worth accelerating
- Auto loan at 4.9%, $14.2K remaining — moderate rate, on track
- Total debt service ~$5,391/mo ($64,692/yr) — DTI ~33%, manageable but elevated
Directive: Always show the math: total interest saved, months shaved off, opportunity cost of alternatives. Use side-by-side comparisons.`;
